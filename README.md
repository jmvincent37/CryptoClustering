# CryptoClustering - Module 19

This readme file provides an overview of the instructions and requirements, along with point values, for completing the Crypto Clustering (Module 19) assignment. The assignment involves performing clustering analysis on cryptocurrency market data using K-means and principal component analysis (PCA). 

### Instructions
 1. Rename the starter code file to "Crypto_Clustering.ipynb".
 2. Load the "crypto_market_data.csv" file into a DataFrame and analyze the summary statistics and data plots to understand the data.
 3. Get the summary statistics and plot the data to see what the data looks like before proceeding.

 ### Prepare the Data  
 1. Normalize the data from the CSV file using the StandardScaler module from scikit-learn.
 2. Create a new DataFrame with the scaled data, setting the "coin_id" index from the original DataFrame as the index for the new DataFrame.

### Requirements and Point Values
1. Find the Best Value for k by Using the Original Data (15 points)
2. Cluster the Cryptocurrencies with K-Means by Using the Original Data (10 points)
3. Optimize the Clusters with Principal Component Analysis (10 points)
4. Find the Best Value for k by Using the PCA Data (10 points)
5. Cluster the Cryptocurrencies with K-means by Using the PCA Data (10 points)
6. Visualize and Compare the Results (15 points)
7. Coding Conventions and Formatting (10 points)
8. Deployment and Submission (10 points)
9. Code Comments (10 points)
